# EmojiCrypt Security Audit

**Date:** 20 August 2025
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot (AI)

## 1. Cryptographic Primitives (script.js)

- **Algorithm:** Uses AES-GCM (256-bit) for authenticated encryption, which is modern and secure.
- **Key Derivation:** Uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 150,000 iterations, and a 16-byte random salt. This is strong for browser-based KDF, but not as strong as Argon2 or scrypt (which are not natively available in browsers).
- **IV:** 12-byte random IV per message, as recommended for AES-GCM.
- **Salt:** 16 bytes, randomly generated per message.
- **Versioning:** A version byte is included after salt+IV, allowing for future upgrades.

**Assessment:** The cryptographic primitives are correctly chosen and implemented for browser environments.

---

## 2. Implementation Details (script.js)

- **Randomness:** Uses `crypto.getRandomValues` for salt and IV, which is secure.
- **Key Handling:** Password is directly encoded as UTF-8 and used as PBKDF2 input. No password policy is enforced, so weak passwords are possible.
- **Packing:** Data is packed as `[salt][iv][version][ciphertext]`, then Base64-encoded, then mapped to emojis.
- **Base64/Emoji Mapping:** 65 unique emojis for 64 Base64 chars + `=`, with runtime checks for uniqueness and length. Mapping is bijective and robust.
- **Error Handling:** Errors are caught and displayed to the user, but stack traces are only logged to the console.

**Assessment:** Implementation is robust, with good error handling and runtime checks. The emoji mapping is safe and reversible.

## 3. User Experience & Security (index.html, styles.css)

- **Copy/Paste Robustness:** Emojis are space-separated to avoid copy/paste issues.
- **Clipboard/Sharing:** Uses `navigator.clipboard` and `navigator.share` securely. No sensitive data (password) is ever placed in the URL or shared.
- **URL Hash Import:** Imports emoji soup from URL hash, which is safe (no XSS risk since only value is set to a textarea).
- **ARIA & Accessibility:** Uses ARIA labels and live regions for output, improving accessibility.
- **Semantic HTML:** Uses semantic tags (header, main, section, footer) and proper label associations for inputs.
- **Visual Feedback:** Error and success messages are styled for clarity. Output areas use `aria-live` for screen readers.
- **No Inline Scripts:** All JavaScript is loaded from an external file, reducing XSS risk.
- **No External Dependencies:** No third-party scripts or styles are loaded, reducing supply chain risk.

**Assessment:** The UI is accessible, user-friendly, and does not introduce security risks. The CSS is modern, visually appealing, and does not leak sensitive information.

## 4. Browser-Specific & General Risks (All Files)

- **Side-Channel Attacks:** As with all browser crypto, side-channel attacks (timing, memory, etc.) are possible but not likely in casual use.
- **Password Security:** No password strength enforcement. Users can use weak passwords, which reduces security.
- **No Integrity for Mapping:** If the emoji mapping changes in the future, old soups become incompatible. This is not a security risk, but a compatibility one.
- **No Forward Secrecy:** If a password is reused and later compromised, all soups using that password can be decrypted.
- **No Brute-Force Protection:** All brute-force resistance comes from PBKDF2 iteration count and password strength. No rate limiting.
- **Clipboard Risks:** Copying emoji soup or links to the clipboard may expose data to other apps on the user's device.
- **No Persistent Storage:** No data is stored in localStorage, cookies, or indexedDB, reducing risk of data leakage.

---

## 5. Potential Improvements (All Files)

- **Password Strength:** Warn users if the password is weak (e.g., <8 chars or common words).
- **Iteration Count:** 150,000 is good, but could be increased if performance allows.
- **KDF Upgrade:** If/when browsers support Argon2 or scrypt, consider upgrading.
- **Clipboard Security:** Warn users that copying to clipboard may expose secrets to other apps.
- **Replay/Reuse:** Each encryption uses a new salt/IV, so ciphertexts are unique even for the same message/password.
- **Accessibility:** Consider adding more ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation hints for even better accessibility.
- **Visual Security Cues:** Consider adding a warning banner for users about the casual security level of the app.

## 6. No Critical Vulnerabilities Found

- No evidence of cryptographic misuse, insecure randomness, or XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities.
- All cryptographic operations are performed using the Web Crypto API, which is secure.
- The emoji mapping is robust and does not introduce ambiguity or collisions.
- The HTML and CSS do not introduce security or privacy risks.

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Warn users about weak passwords** and encourage strong passphrases.
2. **Document** that emoji soups are not compatible across mapping/version changes.
3. **Consider** increasing PBKDF2 iterations if performance allows.
4. **Remind users** that browser-based crypto is not suitable for high-value secrets.
5. **Add accessibility and security cues** in the UI for even better user safety.

**Conclusion:**
Your implementation is secure for casual use and demonstrates good cryptographic hygiene for a browser-based app. There are no critical vulnerabilities. The main risks are user password strength and the inherent limitations of browser cryptography. The HTML and CSS are clean, accessible, and do not introduce security issues.

If you want, I can implement a password strength warning, accessibility improvements, or other enhancements. Let me know!
