# EmojiCrypt Security Audit (script.js)

**Date:** 20 August 2025  
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot (AI)

## 1. Cryptographic Primitives

- **Algorithm:** Uses AES-GCM (256-bit) for authenticated encryption, which is modern and secure.
- **Key Derivation:** Uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 150,000 iterations, and a 16-byte random salt. This is strong for browser-based KDF, but not as strong as Argon2 or scrypt (which are not natively available in browsers).
- **IV:** 12-byte random IV per message, as recommended for AES-GCM.
- **Salt:** 16 bytes, randomly generated per message.
- **Versioning:** A version byte is included after salt+IV, allowing for future upgrades.

**Assessment:** The cryptographic primitives are correctly chosen and implemented for browser environments.

## 2. Implementation Details

- **Randomness:** Uses `crypto.getRandomValues` for salt and IV, which is secure.
- **Key Handling:** Password is directly encoded as UTF-8 and used as PBKDF2 input. No password policy is enforced, so weak passwords are possible.
- **Packing:** Data is packed as `[salt][iv][version][ciphertext]`, then Base64-encoded, then mapped to emojis.
- **Base64/Emoji Mapping:** 65 unique emojis for 64 Base64 chars + `=`, with runtime checks for uniqueness and length. Mapping is bijective and robust.
- **Error Handling:** Errors are caught and displayed to the user, but stack traces are only logged to the console.

**Assessment:** Implementation is robust, with good error handling and runtime checks. The emoji mapping is safe and reversible.

## 3. User Experience & Security

- **Copy/Paste Robustness:** Emojis are space-separated to avoid copy/paste issues.
- **Clipboard/Sharing:** Uses `navigator.clipboard` and `navigator.share` securely.
- **URL Hash Import:** Imports emoji soup from URL hash, which is safe (no XSS risk since only value is set).
- **No Sensitive Data in URL:** Only the emoji soup is shared, not the password.

**Assessment:** UX is good and does not introduce security risks.

---

## 4. Browser-Specific & General Risks

- **Side-Channel Attacks:** As with all browser crypto, side-channel attacks (timing, memory, etc.) are possible but not likely in casual use.
- **Password Security:** No password strength enforcement. Users can use weak passwords, which reduces security.
- **No Integrity for Mapping:** If the emoji mapping changes in the future, old soups become incompatible. This is not a security risk, but a compatibility one.
- **No Forward Secrecy:** If a password is reused and later compromised, all soups using that password can be decrypted.
- **No Brute-Force Protection:** All brute-force resistance comes from PBKDF2 iteration count and password strength. No rate limiting.

---

## 5. Potential Improvements

- **Password Strength:** Warn users if the password is weak (e.g., <8 chars or common words).
- **Iteration Count:** 150,000 is good, but could be increased if performance allows.
- **KDF Upgrade:** If/when browsers support Argon2 or scrypt, consider upgrading.
- **Clipboard Security:** Warn users that copying to clipboard may expose secrets to other apps.
- **Replay/Reuse:** Each encryption uses a new salt/IV, so ciphertexts are unique even for the same message/password.

## 6. No Critical Vulnerabilities Found

- No evidence of cryptographic misuse, insecure randomness, or XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities.
- All cryptographic operations are performed using the Web Crypto API, which is secure.
- The emoji mapping is robust and does not introduce ambiguity or collisions.

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Warn users about weak passwords** and encourage strong passphrases.
2. **Document** that emoji soups are not compatible across mapping/version changes.
3. **Consider** increasing PBKDF2 iterations if performance allows.
4. **Remind users** that browser-based crypto is not suitable for high-value secrets.

**Conclusion:**  
Your implementation is secure for casual use and demonstrates good cryptographic hygiene for a browser-based app. There are no critical vulnerabilities. The main risks are user password strength and the inherent limitations of browser cryptography.

If you want, I can implement a password strength warning or other improvements. Let me know!
